# Custom Themes

**How to make:**

In `assets/themes/` (the folder this file is in), add a folder with your theme name.
An example could be `assets/themes/test/`

In your theme folder, there are four files.

1. `theme.txt`
	The default file that all themes **must** include.
	It contains the colors for pretty much everything.

2. `geometry.png`
	The tile textures for most geometry types.
	Mostly used in Droplet.

3. `ui.png`
	Every special ui image is in here.

4. `uiIcons.png`
	Some very special icons that are rarely used.
	Usually, this doesn't need to be messed with.
